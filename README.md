# trip-flow
Easy to use trip planner.
Written with VueJS and Google-APIs (Firebase, Map/Places), and D3.

## This project is discontinued
While the codes are somewhat functional (assuming the APIs are still working), ultimately it didn't really do what I wanted.

The goal behind the project was to create a one-stop shop for doing trip planning, which for me involve a mixture of using spreadsheets, word documents and plenty of email exchanges. While the project captures the basics: planning a route, it failed to capture the discourses that arise when doing trip planning - the arguments, compromises, uncertainties and other artifacts of a group discourse.
I think these elements are really important, and frankly I have not thought of good ways of capturing them, as such the project is on a indefinite hiatus.
